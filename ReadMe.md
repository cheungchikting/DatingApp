### About Project

This is a dating application that enables users to quickly browse through photographs of other users within a defined proximity. 

When the user comes across someone they are interested in, they can click the “Heart”  button. If the user is not interested in someone, they  can click the “Tick”  button.

After two people click the ”Heart” button with each other ,this condition is called a 'match' and a chat can be initiated between them. 

This application is a combination of frontend and backend.

Frontend uses HTML, CSS, JS, bootstrap, Jquery to build the user interface. Backend uses Node.js and some middlewares to grap and store data. In addition, socket.io  and Redis are also used to form the chat room function.
